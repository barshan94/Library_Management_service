•	A basic library management system designed to organize and manage readers and their interactions with the library. The system is implemented using six primary classes to streamline functionality and structure.
•	Programming Language:
Java
•	Classes Used:
1.	Welcome:
	Handles the initial interface and user engagement when accessing the system.
2.	Special_Reader:
	Represents special readers with unique privileges, such as extended borrowing periods or access to premium resources.
3.	Reader:
	A base class representing general attributes and behaviors of all readers.
4.	Normal_Reader:
	A subclass of Reader, catering to regular library members with standard borrowing rules.
5.	Library:
	Manages library resources, including book inventory, availability, and transactions.
6.	Account:
	Handles reader accounts, including borrowing history, fines, and account details.
•	Key Features:
o	Differentiated user types (special and normal readers) for tailored functionality.
o	A modular class structure for easy expansion and maintenance.
o	Basic account management for tracking user interactions and transactions.
This system serves as a foundational library management solution, showcasing object-oriented programming principles through class hierarchy and modular design.
